# Data :
- Data Preprocessing:
   - Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values and outliers.
   - Features were normalized and encoded for machine learning compatibility.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into trends and anomalies.
# Usage :
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
3. Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
4. View results in the results/ directory.

# Results and Evaluation :
The project successfully identifies key financial risks, visualized through charts and statistical metrics. Example outputs include:

- Risk distribution graphs.
- Correlation matrices highlighting risk factors.
- Predictive analytics models, if implemented.

# Future Work:
- Incorporate machine learning models for advanced financial risk prediction.
- Expand datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
- Automate reporting to generate insights dynamically.
